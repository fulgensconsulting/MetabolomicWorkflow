# Metabolomics Sample Workflow

Project sample of metabolomics bioinformatic workflow from .raw files through signal intensity summation, normalization, and feature selection which covary with study groups

### Study

__Project Title__: Identification of biomarkers in schistosomiasis and associated bladder cancer and pathologies in Eggua, Nigeria
__DOI__: doi: 10.21228/M85M3S
__Summary__: The aim of the project is to develop biomarkers that will aid the search for new therapeutic or diagnostic targets for schistosomiasis and its induced bladder pathologies or cancer. Blood and urine samples from individuals were collected in Eggua, Nigeria for subsequent metabolomics, proteomics and genomics characterization
### Objective

Extract raw metabolomics data, perform sample processing and data normalization, identify mass values which covary with experimental study design.
